# Introduction

Ohhh maaaaannn!! Another Ecto book!!! Why? Why? Whyyyyyyyy?

Well, to be honest, even I don't know why, the real thing is that I have some things to say and every time I do something
at work I think: `I should write this down or people with the same problems will have the same nightmares that I had`

That is the number one reason that I am doing this. And I can say to you, writing is not easy, it's a tirelessly activity,
but hey, no one is forcing me so I better stop complainning.

Let's chat seriouslly now.

Every time I put some hours into a query, or I try to find ways to execute some queries with Ecto, I think about this book. 
Would be awesome if I had a book where the writer had the same problems I have right now and he could help me find the solution
and not only find the solution but explain to me without all the writers enourmous text that we usually find on books?

Heeelll YEAHH!

So yes, I am doing this book, mainly for me. It's a way for me to cristalize some things I already know about Ecto, learn 
some new things that I don't usually have time to and don't use daily basis, and finally, really understand the framework itself.

Call me selfish. I can say to you that I am really not, but based on the previous paragragh you can call me that. I need to 
be brutally honest with you, the best way to learn anything is by doing and I found that writing is one of the best ways for me 
to internalize knowledge. And since I believe that learn by doing is the best approach this book has a lot of code, not only
Ecto code, but some Elixir code as well, so you can follow along and use some active learning insteand of just read the text.
But yeah, I made this book for me first.

That being said, this does not mean that this book is not good for you. Au contraire my dear friend. This book is packed with
knowledge and all the WTF I had trying to do things with ecto and SQL. As I said, not all of them were with Ecto but I am sure 
you will find at least some piece of knowledge in this pages that will help you solve some problem that you have right now with Ecto. 
If not, well, at least you will learn about Ecto and have a good time reading this book. And if you don't have a good time, 
that will be all my fault but I can't do anything about it. Sorry!

So, at first this book would be about some tips and tricks I learned either by doing it, or seeing some real gifted developers 
doing it (and I copied! Don't tell anyone!). 

But them I changed my mind and I decided to start at the begginning, explaining the basics, using a lot of code and building the 
knowledge so we can start from being nothing to become an expert(not exactly). In the end you will be able to read this book to 
either learn how to use Ecto in an Elixir/Phoenix project or just come back to it to remind yourself how to do some tricky stuff.

This book, so far, is divided in four sections:
1. How to install (really small section)
2. How to Query (this is a big one)
3. How to insert and update data (this sits in the middle)
4. Tips and Tricks

By the end of this book you should be confident that you can use Ecto to get or change the data in whatever ways you want. 

I really hope I can fulfill this promisse. Only you will be able to tell me. 

Let's go start this journey!
