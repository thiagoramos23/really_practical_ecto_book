# Disclaimer

This is my attempt to write a book explaining Ecto for the 
beginner but also for the experienced developer.

I want to write a very practical book without all the long
Blah blah blah that we usually see in books.

So, this book, I hope, will not be a very long book but will
have a lot of good examples to simple things that we can do with Ecto but also for very complicated stuff that I have to deal with my work or people I know had to deal with their work. 

## Chapters

1. How to install and configure 
2. How to Query (Everything so you can be a query master)
3. How to Change Data (Everything about create/update/delete data and it's associations)
4. Tips and Tricks (Special examples and advanced ones)
