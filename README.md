This is my attempt to write a book explaining ecto for the 
begginner but also for the experienced developer.

I want to write a very practical book without all the long
texts that we usually see in books.

So, this book, I hope, will not be a very long book but will
have a lot of good examples to simple things that we can do with
Ecto but also for very complicated stuff that I have to deal
in my work or people I know had to deal with their work.
